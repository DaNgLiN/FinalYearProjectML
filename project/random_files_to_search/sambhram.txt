Computer Science & Engineering is the study of theoretical and practical foundations of information processing and computations of practical problems and its solutions. Computer science has many sub-fields; such as computer graphics, emphasize the computation of specific results, while others, such as computational complexity theory, study the properties of computational problems. Some others focus on the challenges in implementing those computations. For example, programming language theory studies approaches to describing computations, while computer programming applies specific programming languages to solve specific computational problems.


The programme gives the students a firm footing into the intricacies of this technology such as circuits, design, structures language, processors, operating systems, database, management, simulation, modeling etc. Manufacturers of computers, electronic gadgetry, communication products, highly specialized processors such as in automobile, aircraft, satellite, shipping etc requires trained computer science engineers.


About the Department

The Department of Computer Science & Engineering of SaIT started in the year 2001. It provides the opportunity for the students to develop a firm foundation in mathematics, science, and design methodology applied to the disciplines of Computer Science & Engineering. It creates an ambience of academic excellence in new innovative ideas, research, development and innovation in emerging trends of computer and information technology.


Standard, constructive rules and procedures are followed in day-to-day operations. The department head is freely accessible to students and faculty members for consultation, sharing of new ideas, and general guidance. A high degree of team spirit is developed and sustained in the department.


The Department of Computer Science & Engineering (CSE) has grown exponentially over the last few years, evolving to meet demands of the 21st century. Department is well equipped with advanced laboratories, class rooms, seminar halls and well experienced faculty members. To improve the quality of students it maintains proctoring and monitoring of students. We regularly meet parents, hold alumni gatherings and technical events throughout the year. We have a team of highly qualified and dedicated teaching faculty well supported by a group of technical creative approach. Department provides Undergraduate (BE-CSE), post graduate (M.TECH- CSE) and Research (PhD) program.


  BE CSE:
The objective of this course is to develop abilities among student community to understand the present industrial issues and to critically interpret the diverse viewpoints regarding possible futures.

Developing and understanding of future techniques and approaches, including their limitations and applications.

Exploring a range of perspectives and styles of how various people and organizations approach future studies and to become acquainted with the future literature.

Gaining experiences with techniques and technologies that should be useful in their own future.


M.Tech CSE:
The M.Tech program started in the year 2014. The specialization offered is computer science and engineering (CSE). Our M.Tech program is aimed at developing experts with technical capabilities and managerial abilities. The educational objectives of M.Tech programs are:

To prepare graduates who will be successful professionals in industry, government, academia, research, entrepreneurial pursuit and consulting firms.

To prepare graduates who will contribute to society as well educated, expressive, ethical and responsible citizens with proven expertise.

To create experts and professionals in computer technology with a view on developing skills those are able to match the demands of the complexities of present generation IT industry.


Ph.D CSE:
Research and Development is most essential part for engineering education. VTU Research Centre in the Department of Computer Science & Engineering was started in the year 2009-10, with provision for Ph.D. (Full Time / Part Time). Since then the research facility is available for research scholars to carry out research in their specific area. Students and research scholars are encouraged to take up inter disciplinary research in various domains like data mining, computer vision, natural language processing, networks etc. Student innovation center is open 24X7 to carry out innovative projects.
